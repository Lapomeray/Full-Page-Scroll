# Full-Page-Scroll
This is a simple script that will allow you to make webpages with sections that captures the full screen when scrolling, creating a sticky effect.

## Requirements
jQuery (3.0 or later)


## Disclaimer 
This project was inspired by @peachananr and his onepage-scroll repository. All javascript files were created by him. I simply cleaned up the excess css and javascript so it is easier for beginners to understand.
